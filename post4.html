  <h3> Loops </h3>
  <p> NOTE: All loops can achieve the same thing. Some just need more work than others.
  <h4> For</h4>
  <p>For Loops are Loops  that are based on a condition and iterate for a specified amount of time,
    Hence "For" as in For x amount of times. The notation for 'For Loops'
    is <br/>
    <code><br/>
      for(x=0; x<10< x++){<br/>
        "Do something"  <br/>
      }</code> <br/>
      this will stop the  code at 10 since it will not add if x is 10 or greater.
  </p>
  <br/>
  <h4>While</h4>
  <p> A while is another condition based loop that accepts a condition and
    repeats itself until the condition is no longer met, much like the for loop.
    The difference is that in a while loop you need to (but not always)
    update the condition so the loop will terminate once the condition is no longer
    met. An example is:
     <code>
       <br/>
       x= 0; <br/>
      While (x < 10){<br/>
        .....do something;
        <br/>
        x++; <br/>
      }<br/>
    </code>
    </p>
    <h4> do while </h4>
    <p> The do while loop is probably the most different loop because it executes
      at least once. It does this by automatically running the code and then checking
      if the condition is still in bounds. <br/>
      Example <br/>
      <code> <br/>
        x=0;
        do{<br/>
        ....code...<br/>
        x++;<br/>
      }while(x < 10);<br/>
      The one noticeable difference is that 'do' comes first and the 'while'
      is outside of the brackets along with the semi-colon.

      <br/>
      <p> As previously mentioned you can accomplish all of the tasks you need with
        any of the three loops but it is best to choose the loop that best fits
        your scenario.
