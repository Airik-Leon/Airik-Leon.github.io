  <h3>If/else vs switch</h3>
  <p>If/else is a conditional statement that checks a condition to see if it is
      true and then if it is true it executes the inner block of the code.
      If it is not true then it moves to the next else if or moves to the next
      else. In terms of memory the if statement makes a comparison each time
      to execute the code. </p>

      <br/> <h3>Switch</h3>
      <p>A switch statement on the other hand accepts a value for a variable
         or a constant and then proceeds to the case that identifies with the
         variable or constant. It does this by sending all the to be compared in
         hash table data structure to make quick comparisons. </p>

      <p>Switch cases and If/else can be used interchangedly meaning that anything
        in a if/else block can be represented in a switch case block and vice
        versa. But, when you proceed to conditions that have a bit of uncertainty
        and you want a little bit of control or a large number of cases then
        it may be wise to use a switch case.</p>
