  <h3> = vs ==</h3>
  <p>First and foremost it is important to nail down the definitin of '=' and
    '=='because in programming only one of these really means 'equals' in the
    mathematical sense. Even then, context matters in how you use them that may
    change the definition of each symbol.<br/><br/>

    '=' should always be read as assignment as in:<br/>
     Bill is assigned the age 10. <code> Bill = 10; </code><br/>
     or<br/>
     Bill is assigned "Bill": <code> Bill = "Bill"; </code><br/><br/>

     If you read it always as assignment that should avoid any pitfalls regarding
     'equals' and assignment statements.<br/>
     As for '==' this should known as a comparison operator which means it requires
     two operands to even work.<br/><br/>

     So <code>'if(2 == 2){do something}</code>makes sense if used with a conditional statement like 'if/else'.<br/>
     But it doesn't make sense if you just type '<code>2 == 2;</code>' because that is not a statement <br/>
     <br/>
     When we get into data types <code> '=='</code> makes a different comparison when
     not used with numbers. With strings and characters it compares their ASCII values totaled
     not the string number so "2" equates to the value 2 because the ASCII value is 2, BUT,
     ASCII value 15 equates to the value "F", meaning "15" =/= 15. In the previous
     example "15" totals to 6. Thus "15" == 6 would comeback as true.
